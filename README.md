# python_challenge
This is the very first project I did using Python. No other libraries were used (such as Pandas). There are two challenges completed in this project:

 1. PyBank - I created a script to do several analyses on profit/loss on a small financial dataset
 2. PyPoll - I created a script to count, and analyze votes in a small election dataset
